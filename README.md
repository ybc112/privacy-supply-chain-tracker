## Project Overview

A blockchain-based supply chain management system that leverages **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** protocol to ensure data privacy while maintaining transparency and traceability. This dApp allows supply chain participants to track products, manage supplier relationships, and verify quality metrics without exposing sensitive business information.

## 🌟 Key Features

### Privacy-First Design
- **Encrypted Sensitive Data**: Product quantities, prices, quality scores, and location data are encrypted using FHE
- **Selective Disclosure**: Participants can grant access to specific encrypted data on a need-to-know basis
- **Computation on Encrypted Data**: Perform comparisons and calculations without decrypting sensitive information

### Core Functionalities

1. **Product Batch Management**
   - Create product batches with encrypted quantity, quality, and pricing data
   - Track product journey through supply chain checkpoints
   - Maintain public metadata while protecting sensitive details

2. **Supply Chain Tracking**
   - Record encrypted checkpoints with location and timestamp data
   - Multi-role support (Manufacturer, Supplier, Distributor, Retailer, Inspector)
   - Real-time status updates with privacy preservation

3. **Supplier Management**
   - Encrypted performance metrics (delivery, quality, compliance scores)
   - Private supplier agreements with encrypted terms
   - Trust score management between parties

4. **Quality Assurance**
   - Encrypted quality metrics and test results
   - Inspector verification with privacy-preserved scores
   - Product recall management with encrypted reason codes

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Smart Contracts

#### 1. PrivateSupplyChain.sol
Main contract managing the core supply chain operations:
- Participant registration with encrypted ratings
- Product batch creation with FHE-encrypted data
- Access control and permission management
- Quality verification by inspectors

#### 2. ProductTraceability.sol
Extended traceability features:
- Component tracking with encrypted percentages
- Quality metrics management (temperature, humidity, shelf life)
- Certification management with encrypted certificate numbers
- Recall management system

#### 3. SupplierManagement.sol
Supplier relationship management:
- Performance metrics tracking
- Encrypted transaction records
- Supplier agreements with encrypted terms
- Audit management system

### Technology Stack

- **Blockchain**: Zama fhEVM (Fully Homomorphic Encryption Virtual Machine)
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity 0.8.19 with TFHE library
- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, wagmi, RainbowKit
- **Testing**: Hardhat, Chai
- **FHE Library**: fhevmjs for client-side encryption

## 🔐 FHE Implementation

### Encrypted Data Types
```solidity
euint32 - 32-bit encrypted unsigned integers (quality scores, ratings)
euint64 - 64-bit encrypted unsigned integers (quantities, prices, timestamps)
euint16 - 16-bit encrypted unsigned integers (percentages)
ebool   - Encrypted boolean values (access permissions)
```

### Key FHE Operations
- **Encryption**: Client-side encryption before blockchain submission
- **Re-encryption**: Selective data sharing with authorized parties
- **Homomorphic Operations**: Comparisons, arithmetic on encrypted data
- **Access Control**: Encrypted permission management
